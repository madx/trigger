    -- trigger --

trigger is a small program that launches a command when files that match a
pattern are changed.

Using trigger is really simple:

  trigger pattern command

The pattern must be a valid Ruby regular expression. trigger recursively
searches for all files in the current directory, and keeps only files that
match the given pattern.

You can use %% in your command, it will be replaced with the name of the file
that has changed.

There are 2 available options:
  -f, --freq: sets the monitoring frequency (defaults to 1 sec)
  -v, --verbose: toggle verbose mode.

EXAMPLE

This command runs bacon tests whenever a spec of lib file changes:

  trigger '(spec|lib)/.*\.rb' bacon spec/*_spec.rb

You can use a shell script to achieve some autotest-like behaviour:
  
  trigger '(spec|lib)/.*\.rb' ./spec.sh

  #!/bin/bash
  log=`bacon spec/*_spec.rb`

  if [ $? != 0 ]; then
    notify-send "Tests failed" "$log"
  fi
